# Blackjack_Object-Oriented-Programming_PY3
This program is a simplified version of the blackjack card game. 
The rules of the game are as follows. 
Players are dealt cards with certain point values. 
Each player tries to get 21 points so as not to exceed it.
Numbered cards (2-10) are counted according to the value on their face.
As has a value of 1 or 11 (depending on what is more advantageous to the player),
and each jack, queen and king has a value of 10 points.
The computer distributes the cards and competes with players from one to seven. 
Opening the round, the computer distributes all two players (not excluding himself) to two players. 
Players see all their cards, and the computer even displays their sum.
One of the dealer's cards remains temporarily hidden.
Then the player gets the chance to choose additional cards.
Each player can choose one card at a time and repeat this action for as long as he wants.
But when the sum of the player's points exceeds 21 (this is the so-called "fury"), 
the player loses. If each player gets a cart, 
the computer reveals his first card and the round ends.
Otherwise, the game goes on.
The computer must draw additional cards until the sum of its points is less than 17. 
If the computer receives a cart, 
all players who did not get it themselves become winners.
Otherwise, the sum of the points of each player remaining in the game is compared to the sum obtained by the computer.
If the sum of the points scored by the player is greater,
the player wins. If it is smaller, 
it loses. If both totals are the same, the player is tied with the computer.
